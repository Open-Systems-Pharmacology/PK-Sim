Over time, multiple other body systems are also affected. To apply this disease state to an individual in PK-Sim, first select the targeted eGFR. Accordingly, the individual will display changes in GFR, kidney volume, kidney blood flow, plasma protein binding, hematocrit, gastric emptying time, and small intestinal transit time.

This parameterization is for individuals with CKD who are not on dialysis. It does not modify the expression or activity of enzymes or transporters - only foundational anatomy and physiology. Users should consult scientific literature for information how the relevant enzymes and transporters for their purposes may be affected.' WHERE disease_state='CKD';
